# File system

An exercise for using a tree data structure to represent a file system

Providing a REPL 

## Implement

* pwd - current path
  
* ls
  
* cd X
* cd ..
* mkdir

## Moving forward

* parsing paths like "cd ../../test"
* rmdir
* Adding types of files

## Advanced

* mkdir with concatenated paths `mkdir child/another_child/sub_folder`


## Using this repo

Start with `git checkout v1` (git tag name) and work your way to v6 (more to come)
